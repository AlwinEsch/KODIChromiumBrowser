### Description
The folder contains all for Chromium Embedded needed parts which are complete required for the add-on.
Normally are own already created binaries from web used to give it as lib and to create add-on with them, this are different
from the normal ones to match Kodi's directory style and few changes on CEF are required.

Here is a small reworked version of the [automate-git.py script](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/raw/master/tools/automate/automate-git.py) included which enable the Kodi related changes in the
source code of CEF. Also contains this folder the needed patch for it.
