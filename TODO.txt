Helper notes for me to forget not a part:
- Allow new added libexpat to use in chromium libcef to prevent outside depend

Audio stream:
- Sync between audio and video not correct now
  - Add way to synchronize chromiums video playback with PTS of Kodi's given audio
- Check by current sandbox shared memory size match in all cases and if not add ways to pass more in several calls
